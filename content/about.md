Hello World!

My name is Jacy and I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft.

In my past life I was a Software Engineer at Electronic Arts and I worked on the popular Need for Speed and The Sims franchises.

I was also the engineering lead at PEXA for PEXA's new international product before I joined Microsoft.

I hold a Bachelor degree of Games Graphics Programming and a Master degree of Business Information Technology from RMIT University in Melbourne Australia.

The opinions I express on my blog posts are my own personal views, not that of the institutions I work for.
