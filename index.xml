My name is Jacy and I&amp;rsquo;m currently as a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft.
In my past life I was a Software Engineer at Electronic Arts and I worked on the popular Need for Speed and The Sims franchises.
I was also the engineering lead at PEXA working on PEXA&amp;rsquo;s new international product before I joined Microsoft.
I hold a Bachelor degree of Games Graphics Programming and a Master degree of Business Information Technology from RMIT University in Melbourne Australia.</description></item><item><title>Common Pitfalls of Event Sourcing</title><link>http://jgao.io/post/event-sourcing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 23:20:45 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://jgao.io/post/event-sourcing/</guid><description>Event Sourcing defines a different way to represent state of the data in a domain. Instead of maintaining the latest state of a single domain object in the database (CRUD), Event Sourcing promotes storing a full history of event logs which can be played sequentially to construct the current or past state of a domain object.
I started working with Event Sourcing over 5 years ago. Many lessons were learned along the journey.</description></item></channel></rss>
